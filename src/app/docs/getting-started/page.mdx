### Choosing Your Role

There are two types of roles available: **Users** and **Production Heads**. The former can explore and participate in productions,
while the latter manage them. Most people will choose to be a user, but your role can be modified later.

<br></br>

_Note: If you are a production head leading a production, you cannot modify your role unless your production is terminated._

### Sign-Up Options

You can choose to create your Crew Match account using Google or Slack if you do not want to remember a password.
A traditional email and password method is also available. Choose any option you prefer.

<br></br>

If choosing email and password, you will need to verify your email to complete your account setup. Other account types will be redirected to the dashboard for their role.
